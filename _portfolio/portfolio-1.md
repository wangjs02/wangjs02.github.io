## Abstract
In this report, the we discuss how semi-supervised learning (SSL) can be
used in kernel regression, particularly Nadaraya-Watson estimator(NW estimator).
SSL here refers to the statistical approach to leverage both labeled and unlabeled to
generate better results in terms of mean square error and other criteria. The method
of SSL is powerful in that it not only focuses on predicting the unobserved points, but
also lays emphasis on explore unspecified patterns (Chapelle et al., 2009). This helps
boost the performance of estimators when labeled data are sparse and expensive to
collect while unlabeled data can be relatively easily obtained. Under the context of
NW estimator, the classical estimator and the self-supervised estimator using labeled
and unlabeled data will be merged into a hybrid estimator. The asymptotic
distribution, mean square error(MSE) and confidence interval(CI) of the hybrid
estimator will be calculated to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSL. Finally,
simulations will be carried out to visualize the performance of each estimator. We
intend to show that the choice of (h, g) is of great importance and the decision
depends largely on the objective of research.
