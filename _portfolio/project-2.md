**Abstract**

In this report, we discuss how randomization test, which is closely linked to causal relation, can be formulated with the potential outcomes framework developed by Neyman (Holland, 1986). 
If binary outcome assumption is made, the whole population could be stratified into four groups and (partially) sharp null hypothesis can be established. Based on such notion, randomization tests motivated by **Fisher’s exact test** are proposed. 
Simulation is carried out to examine how these tests performs against each alternative hypothesis. 
A surprising conjecture that **the test constructed for sharp null** is actually **valid for Neyman’s null** is made. The asymptotic case is proven to be true by **finite population Central Limit Theorem**. In order to understand what finite population CLT means, we finally review the
related papers and discuss how it is validated and what limitations it has.
