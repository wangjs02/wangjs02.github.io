I am an undergraduate student studying Statistics, CS and Economics at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/). And I am currently visiting [UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) as an exchange student. I have focused on mathematical statistics(statistical learning theory, statistical inference, causal inference) and I am excited to explore more about AI safety (reinforcement learning, active learning, inverse reinforcement learning). I am passionate about academic research and wish to be an impactful researcher.
