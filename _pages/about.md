I am a undergraduate student major in Statistics and minor in CS and Economics, at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/). I have focused on mathematical statistics(statistical learning theory, statistical inference, causal inference) and am currently enthusiastically learning about AI safety(Reinforcement learning, active learning, inverse reinforcement learning). I am passionate about academic research and looking for a gap year research opportunity about inverse reinforcement learning in 2023.
